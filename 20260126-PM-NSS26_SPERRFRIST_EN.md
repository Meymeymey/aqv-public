## AquaVentus on the North Sea Summit: Words must now be followed by action

*Offshore wind must be planned together with offshore hydrogen -- for an affordable and resilient European energy system*

**Hamburg, 26 January 2026.** On the occasion of the third North Sea Summit, hosted today by the German Federal Government at the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, the AquaVentus initiative calls for the consistent implementation of political commitments to an integrated use of the North Sea's energy potential. Offshore wind energy and offshore hydrogen production must be planned and deployed jointly in the future in order to reduce costs, relieve pressure on electricity grids and strengthen the resilience of Europe's energy supply.

During a roundtable discussion with heads of state and government as well as energy ministers from several countries, Robert Seehawer, Managing Director of AquaVentus, highlighted the strategic importance of offshore hydrogen production. Green hydrogen produced from offshore wind enables the decarbonisation of hard-to-electrify industrial and transport sectors, avoids land-use conflicts and reduces transmission losses. According to Seehawer, this approach is not only relevant for Germany, but offers significant optimisation potential and cost savings across Europe.

### Hydrogen strengthens European energy resilience and keeps prices affordable

At the same time, offshore hydrogen enhances Europe's security of supply by tapping the North Sea's energy potential as a domestic, scalable and geopolitically resilient source. However, economic viability remains key for market ramp-up. By intelligently combining offshore wind, offshore electrolysis and shared infrastructure for electricity and hydrogen through sector coupling, overall system costs can be significantly reduced. In Germany alone, annual savings of up to EUR 1.7 billion are possible, while at the same time increasing the utilisation of existing offshore grid infrastructure.

"Compared to billion-euro support measures for transmission system operators, investments in research and demonstration projects for offshore electrolysis require only a fraction of the funds, yet deliver substantial benefits for the entire energy system and industry," Seehawer emphasised.

### Offshore sector coupling enhances security, reduces costs and relieves grids

AquaVentus sees offshore sector coupling as the practical implementation of key political objectives, including those set out in the German coalition agreement. Studies, including a Frontier Economics analysis published in November 2025, demonstrate that combining offshore wind, offshore electrolysis and hybrid connection concepts enables a significantly more efficient energy system. In addition to substantial cost reductions, grid utilisation increases, curtailment is reduced, expensive electricity networks are used more efficiently, and more energy is made available to the system overall.

"If Germany does not finally cut through red tape, we will be holding back the whole of Europe," Seehawer warned. "Allowing combined electricity and hydrogen connections, for example, costs the state nothing, but significantly improves the efficiency and economic performance of existing grid infrastructure. Offshore hydrogen is not a niche solution -- it is a central building block for a competitive, secure and climate-neutral European energy system."

The Summit also highlights the industrial policy dimension of the energy transition. Offshore hydrogen creates new scope for innovation, technological development and export opportunities, particularly for the German mechanical and plant engineering sector. In this context, AquaVentus also points to international cooperation, such as the recently concluded Memorandum of Understanding with Hydrogen Scotland.

"If we cling to outdated ways of thinking now, we risk undermining both the energy transition and Germany's industrial base," Seehawer concluded. "Germany must lead the way -- boldly, pragmatically and with a modern mindset. The North Sea Summit provides the right political framework to do so."

### About AquaVentus

The AquaVentus initiative aims to produce one million tonnes of green hydrogen per year from wind energy in the North Sea and transport it to land by pipeline. More than 100 companies, organisations and research institutes along the entire value chain have joined forces to create the framework conditions for the installation of 10 gigawatts of green hydrogen production capacity from offshore wind energy in the North Sea across Europe and to build the necessary transport infrastructure. Due to its climate-neutral production and storability, green hydrogen is the key to decarbonising energy-intensive industries that cannot be electrified -- and therefore an important factor for a green energy transition and the energy sovereignty of an entire continent.
